## A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. 
The following partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes. Correct them
|              Where Made           |
|---------------|:--------:|-------:|
| North America |  Europe  |  Asia  |

We have 4 cases: 
* Sorted ascending F, sorted descending F.
* Sorted ascending T, sorted descending F.
* Sorted ascending F, sorted descending T.
* Sorted ascending T, sorted descending T.
